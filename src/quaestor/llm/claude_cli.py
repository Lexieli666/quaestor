"""``ClaudeCLILLM``: the Claude Code CLI as a subprocess, for a developer on a subscription.

This adapter is why Quaestor can be run live at all without an API key: a developer with the CLI
installed and signed in runs ``quaestor validate --llm claude-cli``, and the Phase 12 study runs
the same way. It is never reached by the test suite, which monkeypatches :func:`subprocess.run`
and reads the captured payload committed at ``tests/fixtures/claude_cli_payload.json``.

The contract needed from the CLI is one non-interactive turn, machine-readable, with no project
context, no MCP servers and no tools. Every flag is a constructor argument, because these flags
belong to a version of somebody else's program: when one changes, a user overrides one argument
instead of waiting for a Quaestor release. The exact flag list and the reason for each is
DECISIONS D-025.

**Authentication.** The default vector deliberately does *not* pass ``--bare``. ``--bare`` restricts
Anthropic authentication to ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`` or an ``apiKeyHelper`` and never reads OAuth or
the keychain, so it cannot run on a subscription login -- which is the only login this project has,
since ``CLAUDE.md`` forbids an API key anywhere. Project context is excluded instead by running each
call in an empty temporary working directory, and MCP servers by ``--strict-mcp-config``. An
operator who does have a key may opt in with ``bare_flag="--bare"``; what it additionally suppresses
(hooks, plugins, auto-memory, user-level ``CLAUDE.md``) is named as a limitation in
``docs/DESIGN.md``, Phase 2. Whether it was passed is recorded on every ``llm_call`` trace event as
``quaestor_bare``, so a published run says which of the two it was.

**Cost caveat.** ``total_cost_usd`` in the payload is the *notional* API price of the turn as the
CLI computes it. A developer running this on a Claude subscription is not billed that money. It is
reported because it is the only cost signal available and it makes ``--max-cost`` enforceable, not
because it is an invoice. Every document that prints it calls it notional.

**Model attribution.** The payload's ``modelUsage`` can name more than one model, because the CLI
bills side work to a small model alongside the model that answered. Picking the busiest of them
would be a guess written into every trace, so the model is what the caller asked for, and the whole
payload -- ``modelUsage`` included -- is carried on :attr:`Completion.raw`.
